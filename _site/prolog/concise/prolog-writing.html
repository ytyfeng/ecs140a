<h2>How to write Prolog programs</h2>

Prolog is a notation for stating logical relations that happens to be
executable.  It has few control structures, because it is very
difficult to assign meanings to control structures.  Accordingly, you
should try to learn how to write declarative programs.  Avoid using
the control structures listed below.  If you find Prolog frustrating
and difficult, you are probably still programming procedurally.<p>

A Prolog predicate consists of multiple clauses.  It is useful to
think of each clause as coding a separate ``case''--first describe
what constitutes the case, then describe the result for that case.
For example, the absolute value of a number is (1) the negation of the
number, if it is negative, or (2) the number itself, if it isn't
negative.<p>

<code><pre>	abs(X, Y) :- X &lt; 0, Y is -X.
	abs(X, X) :- X &gt;= 0.</pre></code>

If a case has subcases, feel free to invent another predicate to deal
with the subcases.<p>

Remember that parameter transmission is by unification.  You can do a
lot of your work right in the parameter list.  For example:

<pre><code>	second([_, X | _], X).	/* 2nd argument is 2nd element of list. */
</code></pre>

You can often simplify code by writing parameters that match only the
specific case you are interested in.  See <code>member</code> and
<code>append</code> for examples.  (Note: when you must program
procedurally, by convention the ``result'' is the last argument.)<p>

Recursion is fully supported.  In other languages you must always test
for the base case first; in Prolog, the base case can (and should) go
last, if it is such that the more general clauses will fail--see
<code>append</code>.  If the predicate is to fail in the base case, it
can (and should) be omitted; for example, the base case for
<code>member</code> is the unnecessary clause:

<pre>	<code>member(_, []) :- fail.	/* No 1st parameter is a member of [] */</code></pre>

You can't keep a value for future use by ``assigning it to a
variable.''  If it is temporary, local information, you can pass it
around as a parameter; if it is relatively permanent information that
should be globally accessible, you can put it in the database (see
<code>assert</code> and <code>retract</code> below).  Prolog has no
functions, so ``results'' must be returned by instantiating one or
more parameters.<p>

Many predicates can be used as generators, to generate one solution
after another until later conditions are met.  For example,

<pre>	<code>member(X, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), X &gt; 3.</code></pre>

succeeds and instantiates <code>X</code> to <code>4</code>.  If backed
into, it re-instantiates <code>X</code> to <code>5</code>.  (But if
you think declaratively, this just says ``<code>X</code> is a member
of the list <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> that is greater than
<code>3</code>.'')<p>

When one clause fails, the next one is tried.  If you want the failure
of a clause to cause the failure of the entire predicate, you can use
a cut-fail combination:

<pre><code>	sqrt(X, RootX) :- X &lt; 0, !, fail.
	</code><i>(more clauses of sqrt should follow)</i></pre>

This is a procedural shortcut that avoids the necessity of having
<code>X &lt;= 0</code> in every clause; it is justified only if the
test is complex and there are many clauses.<p>

Arithmetic is performed only upon request.  For example,
<code>2+2=4</code> will fail, because <code>4</code> is a number but
<code>2+2</code> is a structure with functor '+'.  Prolog cannot work
arithmetic backwards; the following definition of square root ought to
work when called with <code>sqrt(25, R)</code>, but it doesn't.<p>

<pre>	<code>sqrt(X, Y) :- X is Y * Y.	/* Requires that Y be instantiated. */</code></pre>

Arithmetic is procedural because Prolog isn't smart enough to solve
equations, even simple ones.  This is a research area.<p>

It is possible to build a so-called <i>fail loop</i> in Prolog.  Such
a loop has the form <i>generate-process-test;</i> the loop repeats if
the test fails.  For example, the following will print the elements of
a list, one per line:

<pre>	<code>print_elements(List) :- member(Element, List), write(Element), nl, fail.</code></pre>

However, if the processing is at all complex, it may be difficult to
backtrack over it safely.  Tail recursion is safer, cleaner, and
usually more efficient:

<pre>	<code>print_elements([Head | Tail]) :- write(Head), nl, print_elements(Tail).</code></pre>

Both of these fail after printing the list.  If this is undesirable
(and it probably is), a simple idiom is to add another clause whose
purpose is to unconditionally succeed after the first clause is done:

<pre>	<code>print_elements(_).</code></pre>
