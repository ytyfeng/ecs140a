<h2>Variables</h2>

A <i>variable</i> is written as a sequence of letters and digits,
beginning with a capital letter.  The underscore (_) is considered to
be a capital letter.  Examples: <code>X2</code>, <code>Max</code>,
<code>This_node</code>, <code>ThisNode</code>.<p>

Prolog variables are similar to ``unknowns'' in algebra: Prolog tries
to find values for the variables such that the entire clause can
succeed.  Once a value has been chosen for a variable, it cannot be
altered by subsequent code; however, if the remainder of the clause
cannot be satisfied, Prolog may backtrack and try another value for
that variable.<p>

The <i>anonymous variable</i> consists of a single underscore.  Each
occurrence of the anonymous variable is considered to be a new,
distinct variable (i.e. different occurrences may have different
values).<p>

The scope of a variable name is the clause in which it occurs. There
are no ``global'' variables.<p>
