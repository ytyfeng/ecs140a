<h2>A first look at Prolog</h2>

Prolog is a <i>logic language,</i> not an algorithmic language, and
one therefore has to learn to think about programs in a somewhat
different way.  The terminology is also somewhat different.<p>

The following is a simple Prolog program:
<pre>
<code>	man(socrates).
	mortal(X) :- man(X).
</code>
</pre>

The first line can be read, ``Socrates is a man.''  It is a <i>base
clause,</i> which represents a simple fact.<p>

The second line can be read, ``X is mortal if X is a man;'' in other
words, ``All men are mortal.''  This is a <i>clause,</i> or rule, for
determining when its input X is ``mortal.''  (The symbol ``:-'',
sometimes called a <i>turnstile,</i> is pronounced ``if''.)  We can
test the program by asking the question:

<pre><code>	| ?- mortal(socrates).
</code></pre>

that is, ``Is Socrates mortal?''  (The ``<code>| ?-</code>'' is the
computer's prompt for a question.)  Prolog will respond
``<code>yes</code>''.  Another question we may ask is:

<pre>	<code>| ?- mortal(X).</pre>
</code>
That is, ``Who (X) is mortal?''  Prolog will respond ``<code>X = socrates</code>''.<p>
